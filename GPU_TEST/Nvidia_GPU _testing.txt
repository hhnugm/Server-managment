“Running test X on GPU n - Y tests remaining |======= | Z %”
Where:
X is the current test number in the sequence 
n is the GPU number 
Y is the number of remaining tests 
Z is the overall percent completion
Example:
Running test 208 on GPU 0 - 118 tests remaining |=========== | 64 


A typical GPU test performs the following operations:
1. Disable the windowing system to take over the entire screen.
2. Set the display mode and refresh rate.
3. Loop N times:
a. Exercise some aspect of the graphics hardware.
b. Read back the resulting image. 
c. Calculate a 32-bit CRC, or possibly a checksum, to compare against the known 
correct value (golden value) for this GPU version and platform. For video and 
cursor tests use the hardware DAC CRC.
d. If the golden values do not match, report an error and abort the loop. 
4. Restore previous display mode and refresh rate.
5. Release screen to the operating system.
6. Report test status
